This project was take from these instructions: For this assignment, we will be rejoining our old friends, Barbara & David
Fournier and the rest of the Bowling crew from the Bowling League Database.
We are going to build a website that lists out the information about the bowlers in
the database. The database can be downloaded here:
https://byu.box.com/s/4o6737azcrhv04desaanjcebsywbpgis
You will set up a ASP.NET API for the React app to consume to list the bowler
data. React & ASP.NET should work together to display the necessary data.
The app should display the following information about each Bowler in the
database:
• Bowler Name (First, Middle,
Last)
• Team Name
• Address
• City
• State
• Zip
• Phone Number
Create a heading component for the web app that describes what the page is about.
Then create a component that has a table that lists out the bowlers. Use both of
those components in the App component to display the required info.
NOTE: Only display bowlers who are on the Marlins or Sharks teams.
